# aws-serverless-web-app

This repository includes files for a very minimal serverless web application. The application was implemented and hosted with AWS services. The application is for adding/retrieving pet data to/from DynamoDB table. The scripts.js file includes methods for making requests to the REST API created with API Gateway. The python files include the functions that were uploaded to AWS Lambda making the additions and retrievals.
